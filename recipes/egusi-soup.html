      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium-sized saucepan, boil the beef 
          seasoned with salt, smoked paprika, pepper, and onions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you add plenty of water, so you have about 3-4 
          cups of beef stock for the soup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the beef and reserve the stock.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.   
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the onions and saut√© until they are translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the beef, smoked turkey, and crayfish, and continue cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, garlic, and 1-2 cups of 
          beef stock. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring to a boil and simmer for another 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Add ground egusi and simmer on medium heat for approximately 
          ten more minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Add beef stock as needed to get the desired consistency or 
          prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, throw in the spinach and let it simmer for 4-5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust seasonings to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve warm with fried plantains, fufu, yams, or your favorite starchy side dish.
